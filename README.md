# TinyURL App 

This application takes a long URL, assign it a randomly generated 6 character tag, creating a short URL that will re-direct to the original long URL. 

Users are able to register their own account and request shortened URLs for different URLs. URLs are user-specific, and shortened URLs can be used by everyone.
